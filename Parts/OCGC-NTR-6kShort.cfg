	description = Nuclear gas-core-reactor rockets can provide much higher specific impulse than solid core nuclear rockets because their temperature limitations are in the nozzle and core wall structural temperatures, which are distanced from the hottest regions of the gas core. Consequently, nuclear gas core reactors can provide much higher temperatures to the propellant. Solid core nuclear thermal rockets can develop higher specific impulse than conventional chemical rockets due to the extreme power density of the reactor core, but their operating temperatures are limited by the maximum temperature of the solid core because the reactor's temperatures cannot rise above its components' lowest melting temperature.  Due to the much higher temperatures achievable by the gaseous core design, it can deliver higher specific impulse and thrust than most other fission based nuclear designs.  In this design, Open Cycle, Spherical Counter Flow Toroidal, the fissile fuel is kept mostly in a base injection stabilized recirculation bubble by hydrodynamic confinement.  Leakage is roughly 0.25-1% by weight of fuel to propellant.  Also, partially ionized plasma from the gas core is used to generate electricity magnetohydrodynamically, subsequently negating the need for an additional power supply.  Cooling is provided either by the propellant in high-flow mode, or via active radiators with the propellant spending more time passing through the reactor, collecting more heat.
